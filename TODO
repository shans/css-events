TODO List

* ComputedStyleChanged events triggered by phantom style changes are provided
  faked style objects containing only the changed phantom style. They should
  contain complete computedStyle information instead.

* Emulated events should be able to be cancelled when bubbling.

* MatchedCSSRulesChanged events should be triggered for changes in phantom
  rules.

* Phantom styles should be able to be added to existing rules, not just new
  ones.

* Per-selector StyleRuleChanged handlers should not overwrite existing handlers
  when added.

* Should be able to filter on properties when registering StyleRuleChanged
  handlers.

* Global StyleRuleChanged handlers should not overwrite existing handlers when
  added.

* Should automatically detect element creation / removal and style change, and
  remove addElementTree / removeElementTree / styleSheetChanged from public API
